Installation
============

Requirements:

- Python >= 3.4
- Django >= 2.0

Install using pip:

We also upload `pre-built packages <https://github.com/bhch/django-jsonform/releases>`_
on Github in case pip or PyPI server isn't working.


Update your project's settings:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'django_jsonform'
    ]
