Model fields
------------

.. module:: django_jsonform.models.fields
    :synopsis: Model fields


``JSONField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: JSONField(schema=None, pre_save_hook=None, file_handler=None, **options)
    
.. versionadded:: 2.0

It is basically a subclass of Django's ``JSONField``, but for convenience,
it automatically sets up the JSON editor widget for you.


In Django < 3.1, for databases other than Postgres, it uses a ``TextField``
underneath.

**Parameters**:

.. attribute:: schema
    :type: dict, callable

    A ``dict`` or a callable object specifying the schema for the current field.

    A callable is useful for :ref:`specifying dynamic choices <dynamic choices>`.

    The callable function may optionally receive the current model instance. See:
    :ref:`Accessing model instance in callable schema`.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1
        The ability to provide a callable was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.8
        Callable schema may receive an ``instance`` argument.

.. attribute:: pre_save_hook
    :type: callable

    .. versionadded:: 2.10

    (Optional) Sometimes you may wish to transform the JSON data before saving
    in the database.

    For that purpose, you can provide a callable through this argument which
    will be called before saving the field's value in the database.

    The ``pre_save_hook`` callable will receive the current value of the field
    as the only argument. It must return the value which you intend to save in
    the database.

    .. code-block::

        def pre_save_hook(value):
            # do something with the value ...
            return value


        class MyModel(...):
            items = JSONField(schema=..., pre_save_hook=pre_save_hook)

.. attribute:: file_handler
    :type: callable

    .. versionadded:: 2.11

    (Optional) Provide a the url of the view for handling file uploads. See :ref:`document
    on uploading files <file url>` for usage.

.. attribute:: **options

    This ``JSONField`` accepts all the arguments accepted by Django's
    ``JSONField``, such as a custom ``encoder`` or ``decoder``.

    For details about other parameters, options and attributes of the
    ``JSONField``, see `Django's docs
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.JSONField>`__.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_jsonform.models.fields import JSONField


    class MyModel(models.Model):
        ITEMS_SCHEMA = {...}

        items = JSONField(schema=ITEMS_SCHEMA)


``ArrayField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: ArrayField(base_field, size=None, **options)

.. versionadded:: 2.0

A subclass of Django's ``ArrayField`` except it renders a dynamic form widget.

It takes exactly the same arguments as the original class.

It also supports multiple levels of array nesting.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_jsonform.models.fields import ArrayField


    class MyModel(models.Model):
        items = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=50), size=10)
        # ...

For more details, see
`Django's docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#arrayfield>`__.


Widgets
-------

.. module:: django_jsonform.widgets
    :synopsis: Widgets


``JSONFormWidget``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: JSONFormWidget(schema, model_name='')
    
The widget which renders the editor.

It can be used in a form if you don't want to use the model field.

**Parameters**:

.. attribute:: schema
    :type: dict, callable

    A ``dict`` or a callable object specifying the schema for the current field.

    A callable is useful for :ref:`specifying dynamic choices <dynamic choices>`.

    The callable function may optionally receive the current model instance.
    See: :ref:`Accessing model instance in callable schema`.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1
        The ability to provide a callable was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.8
        Callable schema may receive an ``instance`` argument.

.. attribute:: model_name
    :type: str

    (Optional). The name of the model. It is passed to the file upload handler
    so that you can identify which model is requesting the file upload.

    See :ref:`Handling file uploads` for more details.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    # admin.py

    from django_jsonform.widgets import JSONFormWidget
    from myapp.models import ShoppingList


    class ShoppingListForm(forms.ModelForm):
        model = ShoppingList
        fields = '__all__'
        widgets = {
            'items': JSONFormWidget(schema=ShoppingList.ITEMS_SCHEMA)
        }

    class ShoppingListAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        form = ShoppingListForm

    admin.site.register(ShoppingList, ShoppingListAdmin)


This widget can not be used directly with Django's ``ArrayField`` because
Django's ``ArrayField`` converts the value from array to a string before passing
it to the widget whereas it expects a list or a dict.


Accessing model instance in callable schema
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.8

Automatically accessing model instance in a widget is not possible. This is due
the way Django initialises the widgets and form fields.

However, you can bypass this limitation by manually setting an ``instance``
attribute on the widget.

.. code-block::

    def callable_schema(instance):
        # ... do something ...
        pass

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        json_field = JSONField(schema=callable_schema)


    # create a custom modelform
    class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
        def __init__(self):
            # manually set the current instance on the widget
            self.fields['json_field'].widget.instance = self.instance


    # set the form on the admin class
    class MyAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        form = MyModelForm

Now, the value of the instance will be passed to your callable schema function.
