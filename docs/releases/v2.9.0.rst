.. _breaking-changes-2-9-0:

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internal HTML structure of the widget, i.e. how the the fields are rendered,
has been changed. Due to this, some of the CSS code has also been changed.

You don't need to worry about this unless you've written custom CSS styles for the
widget. If so, this is something to beware for.
