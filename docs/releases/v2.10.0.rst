django-jsonform 2.10.0 release notes
====================================


Jun 03, 2022
------------

This version introduces no breaking changes and is fully backwards-compatible
with the previous releases (2.9.x)

Like the previous version, it also supports ``Django >= 2.0`` and ``Python >= 3.4``.


What's new
~~~~~~~~~~


New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``additionalProperties`` can accept a schema now. Earlier, ``additionalProperties``
  only accepted a boolean and the new properties (keys) could only be of string type.
  Now you can provide a schema for new properties through this schema.
- Support for :ref:`recursive nesting` objects and items.
- Support for :ref:`referencing schema` (using the ``$ref`` keyword).
- :class:`~django_jsonform.models.fields.JSONField` now accepts a new parameter called
  ``pre_save_hook`` which can be used to process or transform the JSON data before saving.


Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- :issue:`38`: If an array has ``minItems`` set to 0 or undefined, it will be kept blank initially.
  If it has a default value, it will use the default value instead of being blank.
  Earlier, an empty item was automatically added to an array which could be undesirable in many cases.


react-json-form (JavaScript)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`react-json-form <https://github.com/bhch/react-json-form>`_ has been updated
to version 1.12.1.
